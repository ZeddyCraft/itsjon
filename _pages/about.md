I’m a cross-cultural researcher with a dual background in Psychology and Anthropology, having graduated from Boston University. My work sits at the intersection of culture and mental health, exploring how cultural frameworks shape emotional expression, influence treatment outcomes, and contribute to disparities in care—particularly among at-risk communities. I'm especially interested in how culturally grounded knowledge can be integrated into mental health interventions to cultivate more equitable, responsive, and effective care.

In September 2025, I will be joining the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) at Yale University as a Melvin Ember Intern, where I’ll contribute to cross-cultural research initiatives and potentially launch an independent project under the mentorship of Dr. Carol Ember.

My Works
======

My most recent work includes a Senior Honors Thesis under Dr. Luke Glowacki, where I investigated the role of post-combat purification rituals in mitigating symptoms of PTSD. Supported by multiple competitive research grants, I built a cross-cultural database from ethnographic materials and used Bayesian statistical methods to identify patterns associated with psychological healing. This research has been presented at both regional and national conferences and is currently being prepared for publication.

Beyond this project, I’ve contributed to diverse research efforts in clinical, cultural, and psycholinguistic. As Project Coordinator at BU’s Psycholinguistics Lab, I led a team investigating the “foreign language effect” in Mandarin-English speakers. I’ve also conducted cross-cultural analyses of peacemaking practices and developed strong skills in both qualitative and quantitative research—ranging from ethnographic coding to statistical modeling in R, SPSS, and Excel.

My applied work with local schools and youth organizations in Boston has reinforced my commitment to making research actionable and grounded in lived experience. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary inquiry and community-based collaboration to shape a more inclusive future for mental health science.
