I’m a cross-cultural researcher with a dual background in Psychology and Anthropology, having graduated from Boston University. My work sits at the intersection of culture and mental health, exploring how cultural frameworks shape emotional expression, influence treatment outcomes, and contribute to disparities in care—particularly among at-risk communities. I'm especially interested in how culturally grounded knowledge can be integrated into mental health interventions to cultivate more equitable, responsive, and effective care.

In September 2025, I will be joining the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) at Yale University as a Melvin Ember Intern, where I’ll contribute to cross-cultural research initiatives and potentially launch an independent project under the mentorship of Dr. Carol Ember.
