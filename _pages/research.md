PTSD & Post-Combat Rituals
======
My most recent work includes a Senior Honors Thesis under Dr. Luke Glowacki, where I investigated the role of post-combat purification rituals in mitigating symptoms of PTSD. Supported by multiple competitive research grants, I built a cross-cultural database from ethnographic materials and used Bayesian statistical methods to identify patterns associated with psychological healing. This research has been presented at both regional and national conferences and is currently being prepared for publication.

Language & Emotions
======
I was a Project Coordinator at the Psycholinguistics Lab, advised by Dr. Catherine Caldwell-Harris, looking into the Foreign Language Effect on Chinese international students through storytelling. As Project Coordinator, I managed a team of undergraduate researchers, helping to lead our student-run research project. Some of my notable works in the project included designing our lab experiment and protocols, coordinating weekly meeting with our students and advisor, conducting analysis on our data collected, and presenting at conferences and symposiums. Our lab project is undergoing publication soon.
