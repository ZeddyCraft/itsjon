My Works
======
My most recent work includes a Senior Honors Thesis under Dr. Luke Glowacki, where I investigated the role of post-combat purification rituals in mitigating symptoms of PTSD. Supported by multiple competitive research grants, I built a cross-cultural database from ethnographic materials and used Bayesian statistical methods to identify patterns associated with psychological healing. This research has been presented at both regional and national conferences and is currently being prepared for publication.
