I have been playing music since I was little, having done band and orchestra my entire academic career. I have been actively involved in my school's band, particularly in the Boston University's Pep Band, Marching Band, & Winter Drumline, having played on saxophone(primary), trumpet, and even percussion. Even now, I strive to improve on my musicianship and keep music as a core component of my career.

Student Arrangement
======
During my undergraduate career, I have had the chance to dabble in arrangement and composition. I have arranged and composed many different genres, from pop songs, movie/tv soundtracks, jazz, and even remixes of that trending reel from Andy Arthur Smith's "Oh When The Saints Go Marching In". Many of my arrangements have ended up getting added to performances/shows around my school's band. A notable example being the Gitchee Gitchee Goo song from Phineas and Ferb being in the BU Pep Book.

Kappa Kappa Psi
======
Since 2023, I have been a member of the honorary band fraternity, Kappa Kappa Psi, having served as Brotherhood Chair & Social Media Chair from 2024-2025. During my time in KKPsi, I got involved in the band's function, helping to set up for band events and rehearsals every week, and engaging in our core pillars of Service, Brotherhood, Musicianship, and Leadership. It was here where I ended up meeting some of my closest friends and colleagues that I still talk to this day. Now, as an alumni, I still hold my connections with my chapter, coming back to help the BU Bands from time to time when needed. If you are a Brother, or even a Sister of Tau Beta Sigma, feel free to reach out to me and we can grab a cup of coffee sometimes and talk about Musicianship.
