Teaching
======
In addition to my research background, I have developed a strong foundation in teaching and mentorship. As a teaching assistant at Boston University, I led review sessions, developed instructional materials, and supported over 100 students in their academic success. I also served as a one-on-one mentor through Boston Partners in Education, working with K–12 students from underserved communities to build confidence, engagement, and academic growth. Reflecting on my experiences here, I ended up developing my ability to provide clear-cut communication, adapt to different learning styles, and create a supportive, inclusive learning environment.

Kendo
======
Outside the classroom, I have trained in Kendo, the Japanese martial art of swordsmanship, since the start of my college year; now holding 2dan/degree blackbelt (as of August 2025). As both a practitioner and senior member within my Kendo club, my approach to discipline, patience, and mentality has been shaped through the martial art, cultivating leadership through example—guiding newer students, upholding tradition, and fostering a respectful, growth-oriented environment. My passion for kendo has led me to pursue interesting projects throughout the year, including doing fieldwork for an in-class final paper (which ended up getting published). What I love about kendo boils down to three factors: the strong sense of community in the martial art, physical and mental aspect across its traditional & competitive setting, & how I was able to combine my passion for it into my academics.
