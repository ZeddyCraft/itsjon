Teaching
======
In addition to my research background, I have cultivated a strong foundation in teaching and mentorship. As a teaching assistant at Boston University, I supported over 100 students by leading review sessions, developing instructional materials, and providing academic guidance. I also served as a one-on-one mentor through Boston Partners in Education program, working with K–12 students from underserved communities to foster confidence, engagement, and academic growth. My career goal is to become a professor/lecturer at a university/college, where I hope to take my research experiences and put them into my teachings. 

Kendo
======
Outside the classroom, I have trained in Kendo—the Japanese martial art of swordsmanship—since the start of my college years, and currently hold a second-degree black belt (2-dan) as of August 2025. As both a dedicated practitioner and senior member of my Kendo club, I’ve developed discipline, patience, and mental resilience through consistent practice. From my time doing kendo, I have help lead new students in the martial arts, upholding its traditions, and foster a respectful, growth-oriented environment for future practitioners.

My passion for Kendo has also extended into my academic work: one of my final course projects, based on fieldwork I conducted within the Kendo community, was ultimately published. What draws me to Kendo is threefold: the deep sense of community it has, the physical and mental challenge it offers in both traditional and competitive settings, and the unique opportunity it has given me to bridge personal interest with scholarly inquiry.
